Bluebird experimental skin
==========================

This skin as been quickly built over colibri default templates to illustrate the benefit of adapting the HTML
generated by XWiki to an existing CSS like bootstrap. Some feature are not yet available, some has rought edge or have
not been reshaped. Why ? Simply because we currently do not have centralized our HTML, and we produce similar HTML
(like the one to produce a button) from many different places. It could happen in a .vm template, a XWikiDocument,
some JavaScripts or a macro. It is therefore really difficult to quickly adapt the HTML to existing CSS.

This skin give access to all the BootWatch variants available from BootWatch.com. BootWatch CSS are simply downloaded
and works AS IS. Here is the sample code you could used to override style.css and select the amelia variant:

    @import "$xwiki.getSkinFile('css/amelia.min.css', true)";
    @import "$xwiki.getSkinFile('css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css', true)";
    @import "$xwiki.getSkinFile('css/font-awesome.min.css', true)";
    @import "$xwiki.getSkinFile('bluebird.css', true)";

For this to be, the HTML generated by XWiki need to be adapted to the markup required by bootstrap. This is done in the
bluebird skin by overriding some .vm, but as said earlier, this is not enough to be complete. A few custom style are
also defined in bluebird.css.

You may enjoy this skin on your wiki at your own risk.
